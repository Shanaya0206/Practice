Introduction to Mobile Application Assignment 2 


Introduction:
 For my second assignment, I designed and developed a native Android application using Kotlin, following the given requirements. To structure data efficiently, I implemented parallel arrays, a method that represents a collection of records by using multiple arrays. Each array stores a specific attribute, with corresponding indices linking related data across them. This contrasts with the array of structures (Arrays of Structures) approach, where all attributes of a record are grouped in a single structure.
Additionally, I incorporated loops throughout my code, as they are fundamental programming constructs that enable the repeated execution of a block of code based on a specified condition. Loops play a crucial role in automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data structures, and enhancing algorithm efficiency. Both parallel arrays and loops significantly contributed to the functionality and effectiveness of my application.
The Purpose of The App:
Flashcards are considered a popular studying tool that is used to test knowledge on various subjects. Due to its effectiveness, I have developed an app that will help prepare students for their upcoming History test. We have been tasked to create a program that prompts users to answer five history questions, score their responses, and display feedback at the end of the game. 
The Design Considerations:
The first step was designing a welcome screen to introduce the game and its purpose. Minimal coding was required for this screen, with the only functionality being a start button that allowed users to proceed to the next screen.
The second screen, known as the flashcard screen, displayed questions and provided users with two response options: "True" or "False." This was the most challenging part, as it involved implementing arrays and loop logic—where most of the coding took place. The key requirements for this screen included initializing a counter and tracking the user's score using a loop structure. I coded two buttons for the "True" and "False" selections and another button to move to the next question. Additionally, a text view was incorporated to display the results of the user's answers. The final button on this screen facilitated navigation to the next section.
The third screen, called the score screen, reviewed all user responses and provided feedback. This aspect of the project also posed significant challenges.

The Use of GitHub and GitHub Actions:
As part of the project requirements, I made use of GitHub for version control to keep my code organized and backed up throughout the development process. I started by creating a new GitHub repository specifically for this project. Once the repository was set up, I linked it to my local Android Studio project using Git integration.

From there, I regularly committed and pushed my changes to GitHub as I made progress. This helped me keep track of each development stage and ensured that I had a secure, cloud-based copy of my work. I found it especially useful for reviewing my previous work and avoiding mistakes.
To make sure the app worked properly, I performed manual testing by checking each screen, transition, and user interaction to confirm that everything ran smoothly and without bugs.

Additionally, I implemented GitHub Actions to automate the testing and build process. This allowed me to verify that the app would build correctly on environments other than just my own computer. I followed the guide provided in the GitHub Actions Marketplace, which helped me set up an automated workflow. I also referred to an example GitHub repository (https://github.com/IMAD5112/Github-) for additional support and guidance.

By doing this, I ensured my app was not only functional but also reliably built and tested through automation.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the development of a native Android application using Kotlin involved strategic implementation of parallel arrays and loop structures to optimize efficiency and functionality. By designing a structured flashcard-based history quiz, the project demonstrated the importance of user-friendly interfaces, logical data handling, and responsive navigation. Additionally, leveraging GitHub for version control and integrating GitHub Actions streamlined the development process, ensuring reliable builds and automated testing. This assignment not only reinforced foundational mobile development principles but also emphasized the value of structured coding, iterative refinement, and best practices in software engineering.
